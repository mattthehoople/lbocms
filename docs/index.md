Good question.

So you've built a beautiful site in flat HTML, CSS and Javascript and you need to add a little bit of cms to a couple of the pages. The last thing you want to do is chop up your whole design, pass it off to a techie to mix with whatever flavor of special sauce is popular this month, and then be faced with the prospect of maintaining and editing this scary mess on a server you hate. If you have to look at one more cPanel interface you'll cry. So what do you do? What do you do?

You could chop up your site slightly differently and use one of the many static site generating tools that are available these days, and in a lot of cases this is a pretty good solution. But sometimes your client doesn't want to learn markdown and sometimes you don't want to have to regenerate the site every time you make a change. So that's out. What now?

You could use one of the new "Content platforms" that are starting to appear. They have APIs. They're hosted somewhere so you don't have to maintain them. But you're not a media company, you're a web designer with a nice site that just needs a little bit of cms. Plus - monthly subscription? This site will be live for years - how can figure out what to charge my client? That sounds horrible. No thanks. Next.

Kind of out of options now. Unless...

You come here and try this. We say it's easy. But easy for who? We say you just need to "do a bit of javascript cut and pasting" and "create some templates", and that sounds awfully like the stuff you're trying to avoid.

So let's work through it and see. Shall we?
